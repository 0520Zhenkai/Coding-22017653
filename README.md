"We are used to reacting to the ever-changing stimuli of the world. We live in a constant counterattack, never stopping to decipher the development of a varied reality, redefining our attitudes each time, and aware of the risk of making mistakes." 
--Calvino, Bitter Tranquillity
Inspiration: based on a renewed exploration of domestic abuse, I discovered that there are many people who suffer domestic abuse many years after they have been married. In the beginning, they love each other, but as time shifts, the love seems to pass away, followed by the affection that should come with it, as the whole person starts to become indifferent and start punching and kicking their own family members because they suffer from the pressure of earning money and the pressure of family. So, based on this phenomenon, I went ahead and wrote a small project in coding to reflect this fact of existence.

Content: I used bees to replace people who should be flying freely, who love nature and life, but who are no longer flying and joyful because of the confinement of their cages. The "prison" of confinement is represented by the spinning layers of iron rings and the immovable chains, and no matter how much they are sealed, they cannot fly in the closed and deadly space of the cage. The heart is represented by a physical 3D heart, which is constantly being pierced, and the layers of rings are constantly pierced, so that the heart, which should be whole, is hurt again and again, and finally becomes broken.

Reflection: If you are committing violence, why not calm down, tell yourself why you are bothered, talk about it and work it out? Violence is not the answer, while it makes your life harder, so in your distraught state, why not go out for a walk, listen to a song and let your sanity overcome your inner demons. If you are suffering from violence, not only physical violence, but also verbal and mental violence, I hope you will be brave enough to follow your heart, to fight back, to leave and let him get the punishment he deserves, and accordingly, you will gain your own freedom by leaving or fighting back.
